When the Norse gods left our land and went back to valhalla they left the remainings of an ancient city, 
it was for a long time sacred, and forbidden to enter.

But in the wars that shattered the world, the remaining of the vikings has fleed to "Norse Land" and is now praying to the gods for help
to defend their old lands agains the invaders.

The time of civil war is over, the time of revenge is near.
